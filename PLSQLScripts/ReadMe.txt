Sequel statement and procedural statements the sequel statements's are used to fetch the data from the database and the procedural statements are used to process that data and control that entire program flow.

You see in the sequel program you can define all your business logic and based on that logic you can process the data.

When is it procedural It means an ordered steps that the computer follows to produce a result.

Sequel alone is not enough because sequel does not support looping and conditional statements to control the business flow.

It cannot execute more than one statement.

That means if you have multiple sequence statements to execute.

We have to issue one statement at that time.

Therefore it increases the network traffic.

Whenever you execute a sequel and it throws an error it does say system defined error message which the business user might not understand.

Sequel does not support Code reusability.

PLSQL is completely portable high performance transaction processing language that offers several advantages.
*Support for SQL.
*Support for object oriented programming.
*Better performance since SQL and PLSQL are so tightly integrated with the database all your statement processing it really fast.
*Higher Productivity
*Full Portability
*Tight Integration with Oracle
*Tight Security

PLSQL is a block structured language that means PLSQL is broken down into logical blocks of code.
